Welcome to the StackOBot (C#) repository! 

This project is an ongoing effort to convert [StackOBot](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/paths/yG/stack-o-bot), originally created in Blueprints, into C# using [UnrealSharp](https://github.com/UnrealSharp/UnrealSharp).

The C# code is a copy of the BPs created by Epic Games.
